1. Key elements explanation:
   - Background (#f0f8ff): Represents the global map, typically a shade of blue or green for oceans and land masses.
   - Text ("tectonic plates"): The main topic of the diagram, introducing the concept of tectonic plates.
   - Rectangle (100% width, 100% height): Encloses the entire diagram, ensuring consistency across different platforms.
   - Title: Provides a brief description of the diagram's content for accessibility purposes.
   - Metadata: Includes descriptive information about the diagram, such as its title and a short description, which can be useful for search engines and other purposes.

2. Real-world applications:
Understanding tectonic plates is essential in geology, earthquake studies, plate boundary research, and even climate change studies. It helps predict the occurrence of natural disasters like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, aids in resource exploration, and contributes to understanding the movement of continents over millions of years.

3. Common student misconceptions:
- Misconception 1: Tectonic plates are solid, rigid blocks that never move. In reality, tectonic plates are continuously moving at different speeds, with some moving as fast as a few centimeters per year.
- Misconception 2: Tectonic plates only affect earthquake-prone regions. While the risk of earthquakes is higher in areas where tectonic plates collide or slide past each other, tectonic activity influences global geology and contributes to various geological phenomena worldwide.

4. Interactive learning suggestions:
   - Virtual Reality (VR) simulations: Allow students to explore the Earth's crust and tectonic plate boundaries, helping them visualize and understand how these plates move over time and contribute to various geological events.
   - Interactive online diagrams and games: Engage students with interactive activities like dragging tectonic plates to simulate their movement or predicting the likelihood of earthquakes based on plate interactions.
   - Group projects: Organize group projects where students research different types of tectonic plate boundaries, such as convergent, divergent, and transform, and present their findings in creative ways, like creating videos or diagrams.
   - Hands-on experiments: Encourage students to create models of tectonic plates using clay or other materials, allowing them to physically manipulate the plates and observe their movements and interactions.
   - Field trips and guest speakers: Organize field trips to earthquake museums, geological sites, or invite geologists to speak about their research and tectonic plate studies, providing real-world context and inspiring students' interest in the topic.
